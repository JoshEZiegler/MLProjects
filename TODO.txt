TODO list ordered roughly by priority/ease of execution:

- Train a variety of models to compare their embeddings 
	-dual/triple/single target linear models written
	-also penta (added tower_damage diff and total)
	-maybe add some dense layers after embedding? 
		-probably unnecessary
		-could make embedding less good?
- Add some more targets to the multi-target linear model to use collected data
- Get hero data from dota2 files (npc_heroes mainly)
	-need to learn how to parse .vpk files
	-see https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/KeyValues
- Collect per-player gold/kill/death/xp data for per-player model
- Write per-player gold/kill/death model
	-Use hero -> embedding -> player stats
	-combine with other hero embeddings?
		-could use average of other 9 embeddings?
	-Combine per-player model with a win prediction model (easy)
- Write serving scripts as if going into production
	-single model
	-average outputs of a few models
