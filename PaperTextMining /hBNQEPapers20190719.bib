abstract = {We investigate the effect of surface acoustic waves on the atomic-like optical emission from defect centers in hexagonal boron nitride layers deposited on the surface of a LiNbO3 substrate. The dynamic strain field of the surface acoustic waves modulates the emission lines resulting in intensity variations as large as 50{\%}. From a systematic study of the dependence of the modulation on the acoustic wave power, we determine a hydrostatic deformation potential for defect centers in this two-dimensional (2D) material of about 40 meV/{\%}. Furthermore, we show that the dynamic strain and piezoelectric fields of the acoustic wave contribute to the stabilization of the optical properties of these centers. Our results show that surface acoustic waves are a powerful tool to modulate and control the electronic states of 2D materials.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 American Chemical Society. Research on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has been intensified recently due to the application of hBN as a promising system of single-photon emitters. To date, the single photon origin remains under debate even though many experiments and theoretical calculations have been performed. We have measured the pressure-dependent photoluminescence (PL) spectra of hBN flakes at low temperatures by using a diamond anvil cell (DAC) device. The absolute values of the pressure coefficients of discrete PL emission lines are all below 15 meV/GPa, which is much lower than the pressure-induced 36 meV/GPa redshift rate of the hBN bandgap. These PL emission lines originate from atom-like localized defect levels confined within the bandgap of the hBN flakes. Interestingly, the experimental results of the pressure-dependent PL emission lines present three different types of pressure responses corresponding to a redshift (negative pressure coefficient), a blueshift (positive pressure coefficient) or even a sign change from negative to positive. Density functional theory calculations indicate the existence of competition between the intralayer and interlayer interaction contributions, which leads to the different pressure-dependent behaviors of the PL peak shift.},

Color centers in wide bandgap materials may represent a more effective alternative. However, the quest for UV quantum emitters in bulk crystals faces the difficulty of combining an efficient UV excitation/detection optical setup with the capability of addressing individual color centers in potentially highly defective materials. In this work we overcome this limit by employing an original experimental setup coupling cathodoluminescence within a scanning transmission electron microscope to a Hanbury–Brown–Twiss intensity interferometer. We identify a new extremely bright UV single photon emitter (4.1 eV) in hexagonal boron nitride. Hyperspectral cathodoluminescence maps show a high spatial localization of the emission (∼80 nm) and a typical zero-phonon line plus phonon replica spectroscopic signature, indicating a point defect origin, most likely carbon substitutional at nitrogen sites.

Through our group theory analysis combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations we provide several pieces of evidence that the electronic properties of the color centers match the characters of the experimentally observed emitters. We calculate the symmetry-adapted multi-electron wavefunctions of the defects using group theory methods and analyze the spin-orbit and spin-spin interactions in detail. We also identify the radiative and non-radiative transition channels for each color center. An advanced ab-initio DFT method is then used to compute energy levels of the color centers and their zero-phonon-line (ZPL) emissions. The computed ZPLs, the profile of excitation and emission dipole polarizations, and the competing relaxation processes are discussed and matched with the observed emission lines. By providing evidence for the relation between single-photon emitters and local defects in h-BN, this work provides the first steps towards harnessing quantum dynamics of these color centers.},

Recently, color centers hosted by two-dimensional hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have emerged as a promising platform for high luminosity room temperature single-photon sources. Despite the brightness of the emitters, the spectrum is rather broad and the single-photon purity is not sufficient for practical quantum information processing. Here, we report integration of such a quantum emitter hosted by hBN into a tunable optical microcavity. A small mode volume of the order of {\$}\backslashlambda{\^{}}3{\$} allows us to Purcell enhance the fluorescence, with the observed excited state lifetime shortening. The cavity significantly narrows the spectrum and improves the single-photon purity by suppression of off-resonant noise. We explore practical applications by evaluating the performance of our single-photon source for quantum key distribution and quantum computing. The complete device is compact and implemented on a picoclass satellite platform, enabling future low-cost satellite-based long-distance quantum networks.},

abstract = {Color-centers in solids have emerged as promising candidates for quantum photonic computing, communications, and sensing applications. Defects in hexagonal boron nitride(hBN) possess high-brightness, room-temperature quantum emission, but their large spectral variability and unknown local structure significantly challenge their technological utility. Here, we directly correlate hBN quantum emission with its local, atomic-scale crystalline structure using correlated photoluminescence (PL) and cathodoluminescence (CL) spectroscopy. Across 20 emitters, we observe zero phonon lines (ZPLs) in PL and CL ranging from 540-720 nm. CL mapping reveals that multiple defects and distinct defect species located within an optically-diffraction-limited region can each contribute to the observed PL spectra. Through high resolution transmission electron imaging, we find that emitters are located in regions with multiple fork-like dislocations. Additionally, local strain maps indicate that strain is not responsible for observed ZPL spectral range, though it can enable spectral tuning of particular emitters. While many emitters have identical ZPLs in CL and PL, others exhibit reversible but distinct CL and PL peaks; density functional calculations indicate that defect complexes and charge-state transitions influence such emission spectra. Our results highlight the sensitivity of defect-driven quantum emission to the surrounding crystallography, providing a foundation for atomic-scale optical characterization.},

abstract = {Quantum technologies require robust and photostable single photon emitters (SPEs). Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has recently emerged as a promising candidate to host bright and optically stable SPEs operating at room temperature. However, the emission wavelength of the fluorescent defects in hBN has, to date, been shown to be uncontrolled, with a widespread of zero phonon line (ZPL) energies spanning a broad spectral range (hundreds of nanometers), which hinders the potential development of hBN-based devices and applications. Here we demonstrate chemical vapor deposition growth of large-area, few-layer hBN films that host large quantities of SPEs: ∼100−200 per 10 × 10 $\mu$m 2. More than 85{\%} of the emitters have a ZPL at (580 ± 10) nm, a distribution that is an order of magnitude narrower than reported previously. Furthermore, we demonstrate tuning of the ZPL wavelength using ionic liquid devices over a spectral range of up to 15 nmthe largest obtained to date from any solid-state SPE. The fabricated devices illustrate the potential of hBN for the development of hybrid quantum nanophotonic and optoelectronic devices based on two-dimensional materials. KEYWORDS: hexagonal boron nitride, single photon emitters, two-dimensional materials, low-pressure chemical vapor deposition, electrical tuning S olid-state, single photon emitters (SPEs) are fundamental hardware components for scalable quantum photonics with proposed applications in quantum cryptography, quantum repeater technologies, and entanglement distribution. 1−5 In the past few years, major advances have been achieved in the characterization of single defects in wide-bandgap materials, 1,2,4 as well as single molecules, 6 quantum dots, 3 carbon nanotubes, 7 and more recently layered van der Waals materials. 4,8−11 However, one of the overarching challenges across all platforms is the inability to readily engineer large area (centimeter-scale) materials with uniform spatial and spectral distributions of SPEs. Such a platform is highly desirable for scalable quantum photonic architectures. To tackle this challenge, two-dimensional (2D) materials which can be fabricated by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) are highly advantageous. 12 They can be grown at low cost, using conventional furnaces and precursors, over large areas. However, to date, 2D materials synthesized via this method have not been shown to possess high enough densities of SPEs to be desirable for scalable, integrated technologies. The fabrication of quantum emitter arrays has been pursued by positioning exfoliated flakes on top of lithographically predefined pillars. 13−15 This process is expensive, as it requires e-beam lithography and a subsequent reactive ion-etching step; the size of the 2D material is also limited due to the exfoliation process resulting in smaller flakes. Here we demonstrate that these limitations are overcome by bottom-up fabrication of hBN using low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD). The technique yields large area (centimeter-scale), high-quality hBN films that host a high density of bright and photostable SPEs. The method stands out in terms of scalability and low cost, which are especially desirable for the engineering of integrated devices based on SPEs in 2D materials. 16−20 The as-grown hBN SPEs exhibit a narrow, uniform distribution of ZPLs, which makes it attractive for device integration. We demonstrate this by implementing an electrostatic tuning method for the emitters employing an ionic liquid technique and elucidate the tuning mechanism. Employing the SPEs in few nanometer hBN, we are able to achieve tuning of over 15 nm at room temperature, the largest reported to date. 21−23},

In particular, defects hosted by two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are a promising candidate for next-generation single photon sources, due to its chemical and thermal robustness and high brightness at room temperature. The 2D crystal lattice of hBN allows for a high extraction efficiency and easy integration into photonic circuits. Here we develop plasma etching techniques with subsequent high temperature annealing to reliably create defects. We show how different fabrication parameters influence the defect formation probability and the emitter brightness. A full optical characterization reveals the higher quality of the created quantum emitters, represented by a narrow spectrum, short excited state lifetime and high single photon purity. We also investigated the photostability on short and very long timescales. We utilize a wet chemically-assisted transfer process to reliably transfer the single photon sources onto arbitrary substrates, demonstrating the feasibility for the integration into scalable photonic quantum information processing networks.},

abstract = {Our comprehensive theoretical investigation of hexagonal boron defects established that a carbon-based defect is a likely candidate for visible-light quantum emission. Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has recently emerged as a fascinating platform for room-temperature quantum photonics due to the discovery of robust visible light single-photon emitters. In order to utilize these emitters, it is necessary to have a clear understanding of their atomic structure and the associated excitation processes that give rise to this single photon emission. Here, we performed density-functional theory (DFT) and constrained DFT calculations for a range of hBN point defects in order to identify potential emission candidates. By applying a number of criteria on the electronic structure of the ground state and the atomic structure of the excited states of the considered defects, and then calculating the Huang–Rhys (HR) factor, we found that the C B V N defect, in which a carbon atom substitutes a boron atom and the opposite nitrogen atom is removed, is a potential emission source with a HR factor of 1.66, in good agreement with the experimental HR factor. We calculated the photoluminescence (PL) line shape for this defect and found that it reproduces a number of key features in the experimental PL lineshape. },

abstract = {Quantum transducers can transfer quantum information between different systems. Microwave-optical photon conversion is important for future quantum networks to interconnect remote superconducting quantum computers with optical fibers. Here we propose a high-speed quantum transducer based on a single-photon emitter in an atomically thin membrane resonator that can couple single microwave photons to single optical photons. The 2D resonator will be a freestanding van der Waals heterostructure (may consist of graphene, hexagonal boron nitride, or other 2D materials) that hosts a quantum emitter. The mechanical vibration (phonon) of the 2D resonator interacts with optical photons by shifting the optical transition frequency of the single-photon emitter with strain or the Stark effect. The mechanical vibration couples to microwave photons by shifting the resonant frequency of a LC circuit that includes the membrane. Thanks to the small mass of the 2D resonator, both the single-photon optomechanical coupling strength and the electromechanical coupling strength can be about 100 MHz. This provides a way for high-speed quantum state transfer between a microwave photon, a phonon, and an optical photon.},

Here, we demonstrate the localization and quantitative counting of individual optically active defects in monolayer hexagonal boron nitride using single molecule localization microscopy.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 American Physical Society. Hexagonal BN (h-BN) is attracting a lot of attention for two-dimensional electronics and as a host for single-photon emitters. We study the properties of native defects and impurities in h-BN using density functional theory with a hybrid functional. Native vacancy and antisite defects have high formation energies, and are unlikely to form under thermodynamic equilibrium for typical growth conditions. Self-interstitials can have low formation energies when the Fermi level is near the band edges, and may form as charge compensating centers; however, their low migration barriers render them highly mobile, and they are unlikely to be present as isolated defects. The defect chemistry of h-BN is most likely dominated by defects involving carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen impurities. Substitutional carbon and oxygen, as well as interstitial hydrogen and boron vacancy-hydrogen complexes, are low-energy defects in h-BN. Based on our results, we can rule out several proposed sources for defect-related luminescence in h-BN. In particular, we find that the frequently observed 4.1 eV emission cannot be associated with recombination at CN, as has been commonly assumed. We suggest alternative assignments for the origins of this emission, with CB as a candidate. We also discuss possible defect origins for the recently observed single-photon emission in h-BN, identifying interstitials or their complexes as plausible centers.},

Owing to the high-speed transmission and exceptional noise properties of photons, quantum photonic architectures are likely to play a central role. A long-standing hurdle, however, has been the realization of robust, device-compatible single photon sources that can be activated and controlled on demand. Here we use strain engineering to create large arrays of quantum emitters in two-dimensional hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). The large energy gap inherent to this Van der Waals material stabilizes the emitters at room temperature within nanoscale regions defined by substrate-induced deformation of the flake. Combining analytical and numerical modeling we show that emitter activation is likely the result of carrier trapping in deformation potential wells localized near the points where the hBN flake reaches the highest curvature. These findings, therefore, hint at novel opportunities for the manipulation of single photon sources through the combined control of strain and external electrostatic potentials under ambient conditions.},

abstract = {Single defect centers in layered hexagonal boron nitride are promising candidates as single-photon sources for quantum optics and nanophotonics applications. However, spectral instability hinders many applications. Here, we perform resonant excitation measurements and observe Fourier transform limited linewidths down to ≈50 MHz. We investigated the optical properties of more than 600 single-photon emitters (SPEs) in hBN. The SPEs exhibit narrow zero-phonon lines distributed over a spectral range from 580 to 800 nm and with dipolelike emission with a high polarization contrast. Finally, the emitters withstand transfer to a foreign photonic platform, namely, a silver mirror, which makes them compatible with photonic devices such as optical resonators and paves the way to quantum photonics applications. Single-photon emitters (SPEs) are prime building blocks for a variety of applications in integrated quantum photonics, quantum information processing, and fundamental studies of quantum optics [1-6]. The availability of Fourier transform (FT) limited photons, without spectral diffusion, dephasing, or competing phonon processes, is required for the majority of these applications [1-6]. Single-photon sources with FT limited lines have been demonstrated with atoms or ions in gas-phase organic materials, as well as with solid state systems such as quantum dots and color centers in diamond [7,8]. While those systems have been explored in some of the pioneering nanophotonic experiments, a bright, robust FT limited source that is easily accessible remains a challenge. In this regard, a new emerging class of SPEs is embedded in two-dimensional host materials such as hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) that offers high brightness and may enable novel architectures for integrated quantum technologies [9,10]. The optical properties are promising with a high photostability [11], high brightness [12-14], a large Debye-Waller factor [15,16], good polarization contrast [17-19], spectral tunability [14,15], stable optical lines as narrow as 45 $\mu$eV at cryogenic temperatures [16,20], and, very recently, resonant excitation with lines measured in photoluminescence excitation (PLE) as narrow as 1 GHz [21]. However, the close proximity of the SPE to the host surface makes it susceptible to spectral instability, typically exhibiting a blinking, rapid spectral diffusion and pure dephasing rates much larger than the population decay rates, and therefore zero-phonon lines (ZPLs) much broader than the natural linewidth [22]. In this Rapid Communication, we demonstrate spectrally stable, single-photon emission from the defect center in hBN under resonant excitation without significant spectral diffusion for as long as 30 s. We performed a detailed study of 627 different defect centers in hBN with a central emission wavelength from 580 to 800 nm [17,18,21,23-25]. Resonant excitation reveals linewidths within the FT limit of approximately 55 ± 10 MHz. Our investigated platform consists of two-dimensional hBN flakes mounted on a silver mirror which enables direct integration into photonic structures such as optical resonators, for example, for spin-photon interfaces with Purcell-enhanced, lifetime-limited, single-photon emission. The hBN flakes are cooled in a continuous-flow cryostat to liquid-helium temperature [see Fig. 1(a)]. The excitation and emission polarization is extracted by a linear polarizer and a $\lambda$-half-wave plate probing the incident or emitted polarization via a spectrometer and/or via Avalanch PhotoDiode (APD) counts. For resonant excitation we use a cw Matisse DS dye laser system, which has a mode hop-free scanning range of {\textgreater}40 GHz and a linewidth of {\textless}250 kHz. The wavelength of the laser is monitored via a wave meter from High Finesse with 500-kHz resolution and an acquisition frequency up to 600 Hz. Photoluminescence excitation (PLE) is measured by detecting the phonon-sideband (PSB) emission while the direct laser light is blocked with a low-pass (LP) filter. We evaluate emission spectra from many different SPEs and measure the second-order autocorrelation function in a Hanbury-Brown and Twiss setup (HBT) with g 2 ($\tau$ = 0) {\textless} 0.5, proving the single-photon character of the SPE [see Fig. 1(c)]. The data fit is based on the g 2 ($\tau$) model for a two-level system, g 2 ($\tau$) = 1 − ae |$\tau$ |/$\tau$ 0. (1) Various sites have lifetimes in the range of $\tau$ 0 ≈ 1.53-2.88 ns, resulting in a natural linewidth of ≈ 55-84 MHz, in agreement with previous results [15,21,22]. A background signal originating from the fluorescence of the silver mirror under off-resonant excitation leads to a signal-to-noise ratio of ≈1.4. Background subtraction results in g 2 ($\tau$) = 0.01. As described in Ref. [26], linear polarized or circular polarized dipoles are expected from a symmetry-based group theory approach of the defect centers. We prove the polarization properties by measuring the emission polarization (red data) for the emitter at a 602-nm emission wavelength in Fig. 1(d), with a contrast as high as 0.9 and with an average of 0.},

abstract = {We investigate the polarization selection rules of sharp zero-phonon lines (ZPLs) from isolated defects in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and compare our findings with the predictions of a configuration coordinate model involving two electronic states. Our survey, which spans the spectral range {\~{}}550-740 nm, reveals that, in disagreement with a two-level model, the absorption and emission dipoles are often misaligned. We relate the dipole misalignment angle ({\$}{\{}\backslashDelta{\}}{\{}\backslashtheta{\}}{\$}) to the ZPL Stokes shift ({\$}{\{}\backslashDelta{\}}E{\$}) and find that {\$}{\{}\backslashDelta{\}}{\{}\backslashtheta{\}}\backslashsim 0{\{}\backslashdeg{\}}{\$} when {\$}{\{}\backslashDelta{\}}E{\$} corresponds to an allowed h-BN phonon frequency and that {\$}0{\{}\backslashdeg{\}}\backslashleq{\{}\backslashDelta{\}}{\{}\backslashtheta{\}}\backslashleq 90{\{}\backslashdeg{\}}{\$} when {\$}{\{}\backslashDelta{\}}E{\$} exceeds the maximum allowed h-BN phonon frequency. Consequently, a two-level configuration coordinate model succeeds at describing excitations mediated by the creation of one optical phonon but fails at describing excitations that require the creation of multiple phonons. We propose that direct excitations requiring the creation of multiple phonons are inefficient due to the low Huang-Rhys factors in h-BN and that these ZPLs are instead excited indirectly via an intermediate electronic state. This hypothesis is corroborated by polarization measurements of an individual ZPL excited with two distinct wavelengths that indicate a single ZPL may be excited by multiple mechanisms. These findings provide new insight on the nature of the optical cycle of novel defect-based single photon sources in h-BN.},

abstract = {Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is a tantalizing material for solid-state quantum engineering. Analogously to three-dimensional wide-bandgap semiconductors like diamond, h-BN hosts isolated defects exhibiting visible fluorescence, and the ability to position such quantum emitters within a two-dimensional material promises breakthrough advances in quantum sensing, photonics, and other quantum technologies. Critical to such applications, however, is an understanding of the physics underlying h-BN's quantum emission. We report the creation and characterization of visible single-photon sources in suspended, single-crystal, h-BN films. The emitters are bright and stable over timescales of several months in ambient conditions. With substrate interactions eliminated, we study the spectral, temporal, and spatial characteristics of the defects' optical emission, which offer several clues about their electronic and chemical structure. Analysis of the defects' spectra reveals similarities in vibronic coupling despite widely-varying fluorescence wavelengths, and a statistical analysis of their polarized emission patterns indicates a correlation between the optical dipole orientations of some defects and the primitive crystallographic axes of the single-crystal h-BN film. These measurements constrain possible defect models, and, moreover, suggest that several classes of emitters can exist simultaneously in free-standing h-BN, whether they be different defects, different charge states of the same defect, or the result of strong local perturbations.},

abstract = {Defect centers in hexagonal boron nitride represent room-temperature single-photon sources in a layered van der Waals material. These light emitters appear with a wide range of transition energies ranging over the entire visible spectrum, which renders the identification of the underlying atomic structure challenging. In addition to their eminent properties as quantum light emitters, the coupling to phonons is remarkable. Their photoluminescence exhibits significant side band emission well separated from the zero phonon line (ZPL) and an asymmetric broadening of the ZPL itself. In this combined theoretical and experimental study we show that the phonon side bands can be well described in terms of the coupling to bulk longitudinal optical (LO) phonons. To describe the ZPL asymmetry we show that in addition to the coupling to longitudinal acoustic (LA) phonons also the coupling to local mode oscillations of the defect center with respect to the entire host crystal has to be considered. By studying the influence of the emitter's wave function dimensions on the phonon side bands we find reasonable values for size of the wave function and the deformation potentials. We perform photoluminescence excitation measurements to demonstrate that the excitation of the emitters is most efficient by LO-phonon assisted absorption.},

abstract = {Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) was recently reported to display single photon emission from ultraviolet to near-infrared range due to the existence of defects. Single photon emission has potential applications in quantum information processing and optoelectronics. These findings trigger increasing research interests in h-BN defects, such as revealing the nature of the defects. Here, we report another intriguing defect property in h-BN, namely photolumines-cence (PL) upconversion (anti-Stokes process). The energy gain by the PL upconversion is about 162 meV. The anomalous PL upconversion is attributed to optical phonon absorption in the one-photon excitation process, based on excitation power, excitation wavelength, and temperature-dependence investigations. Possible constitutions of the defects are discussed from the results of scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) studies and theoretical calculations. These findings show that defects in h-BN exhibit strong defect-phonon coupling. The results from STEM and theoretical calculations are beneficial for understanding the constitution of the h-BN defects. T he emitted photon energy in a semiconductor is normally less than the excitation photon energy (Stokes process or downconversion). In some cases, however, photoluminescence (PL) occurs at energies higher than that of excitation photons (anti-Stokes process), and this is referred to as PL upconversion. This phenomenon has been widely observed in lead-halide perovskites, 1,2 transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), 3−5 quantum dots, 6 dye molecules, 7 and carbon nanotubes. 8 The underlying mechanisms of the PL upconver-sion are proposed to be Auger excitation, 9 multiple-photon absorption, 10 or the thermal effect (phonon absorption), 8,11 sometimes in conjunction with intermediate states with energies resonant with or lower than those of the excitation photons. 8 Potential applications of the PL upconversion process include semiconductor cooling, 2,11 high efficiency solar cells, 12,13 bioimaging, 14,15 and so on.},

Recently, hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has emerged as a promising platform for nanophotonics, following reports of hyperbolic phonon-polaritons and optically stable, ultra-bright quantum emitters. However, exploitation of hBN in scalable, on-chip nanophotonic circuits, quantum information processing and cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) experiments requires robust techniques for the fabrication of monolithic optical resonators. In this letter, we design and engineer high quality photonic crystal cavities from hBN. We employ two approaches based on a focused ion beam method and a minimally-invasive electron beam induced etching (EBIE) technique to fabricate suspended two dimensional (2D) and one dimensional (1D) cavities with quality (Q) factors in excess of 2,000. Subsequently, we show deterministic, iterative tuning of individual cavities by direct-write, single-step EBIE without significant degradation of the Q-factor. The demonstration of tunable, high Q cavities made from hBN is an unprecedented advance in nanophotonics based on van der Waals materials. Our results and hBN processing methods open up promising new avenues for solid-state systems with applications in integrated quantum photonics, polaritonics and cavity QED experiments.},

This is a strong indication that the emitters possess a complex level scheme and cannot be described by a simple two or three level system.

In this field, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has been reported to host single quantum emitters (QEs), linking QE density to perimeters. Furthermore, curvature/perimeters in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) have demonstrated a key role in QE formation. We investigate a curvature-abundant BN system - quasi one-dimensional BN nanotubes (BNNTs) fabricated via a catalyst-free method. We find that non-treated BNNT is an abundant source of stable QEs and analyze their emission features down to single nanotubes, comparing dispersed/suspended material. Combining high spatial resolution of a scanning electron microscope, we categorize and pin-point emission origin to a scale of less than 20 nm, giving us a one-to-one validation of emission source with dimensions smaller than the laser excitation wavelength, elucidating nano-antenna effects. Two emission origins emerge: hybrid/entwined BNNT. By artificially curving h-BN flakes, similar QE spectral features are observed. The impact on emission of solvents used in commercial products and curved regions is also demonstrated. The 'out of the box' availability of QEs in BNNT, lacking processing contamination, is a milestone for unraveling their atomic features. These findings open possibilities for precision engineering of QEs, puts h-BN under a similar 'umbrella' of TMDC's QEs and provides a model explaining QEs spatial localization/formation using electron/ion irradiation and chemical etching.},

abstract = {Luminescent defect-centers in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have emerged as a promising 2D-source of single photon emitters (SPEs) due to their high brightness and robust operation at room temperature. The ability to create such emitters with well-defined optical properties is a cornerstone towards their integration into on-chip photonic architectures. Here, we report an effective approach to fabricate hBN single photon emitters (SPEs) with desired emission properties in two isolated spectral regions via the manipulation of boron diffusion through copper during atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition (APCVD)--a process we term gettering. Using the gettering technique we deterministically place the resulting zero-phonon line (ZPL) between the regions 550-600 nm or from 600-650 nm, paving the way for hBN SPEs with tailored emission properties across a broad spectral range. Our ability to control defect formation during hBN growth provides a simple and cost-effective means to improve the crystallinity of CVD hBN films, and lower defect density making it applicable to hBN growth for a wide range of applications. Our results are important to understand defect formation of quantum emitters in hBN and deploy them for scalable photonic technologies.},

abstract = {Ar plasma etching and annealing are highly robust in generating oxygen related single photon emitters in hBN. Artificial atomic systems in solids are becoming increasingly important building blocks in quantum information processing and scalable quantum nanophotonic networks. Amongst numerous candidates, 2D hexagonal boron nitride has recently emerged as a promising platform hosting single photon emitters. Here, we report a number of robust plasma and thermal annealing methods for fabrication of emitters in tape-exfoliated hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) crystals. A two-step process comprising Ar plasma etching and subsequent annealing in Ar is highly robust, and yields an eight-fold increase in the concentration of emitters in hBN. The initial plasma-etching step generates emitters that suffer from blinking and bleaching, whereas the two-step process yields emitters that are photostable at room temperature with emission wavelengths greater than ∼700 nm. Density functional theory modeling suggests that the emitters might be associated with defect complexes that contain oxygen. This is further confirmed by generating the emitters via annealing hBN in air. Our findings advance the present understanding of the structure of quantum emitters in hBN and enhance the nanofabrication toolkit needed to realize integrated quantum nanophotonic circuits.},

abstract = {We present comprehensive optical studies of recently discovered single photon sources in boron nitride, which appear in form of narrow lines emitting centres. Here, we aim to compactly characterise their basic optical properties, including the demonstration of several novel findings, in order to inspire discussion about their origin and utility. Initial inspection reveals the presence of narrow emission lines in boron nitride powder and exfoliated flakes of hexagonal boron nitride deposited on Si/SiO2 substrates. Generally rather stable, the boron nitride emitters constitute a good quality visible light source. However, as briefly discussed, certain specimens reveal a peculiar type of blinking effects, which are likely related to existence of meta-stable electronic states. More advanced characterisation of representative stable emitting centres uncovers a strong dependence of the emission intensity on the energy and polarisation of excitation. On this basis, we speculate that rather strict excitation selectivity is an important factor determining the character of the emission spectra, which allows the observation of single and well-isolated emitters. Finally, we investigate the properties of the emitting centres in varying external conditions. Quite surprisingly, it is found that the application of a magnetic field introduces no change in the emission spectra of boron nitride emitters. Further analysis of the impact of temperature on the emission spectra and the features seen in second-order correlation functions is used to provide an assessment of the potential functionality of boron nitride emitters as single photon sources capable of room temperature operation.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 American Chemical Society. Quantum emitters in two-dimensional hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are attractive for a variety of quantum and photonic technologies because they combine ultra-bright, room-temperature single-photon emission with an atomically thin crystal. However, the emitter's prominence is hindered by large, strain-induced wavelength shifts. We report the discovery of a visible-wavelength, single-photon emitter (SPE) in a zero-dimensional boron nitride allotrope (the boron nitride nanococoon, BNNC) that retains the excellent optical characteristics of few-layer hBN while possessing an emission line variation that is lower by a factor of 5 than the hBN emitter. We determined the emission source to be the nanometer-size BNNC through the cross-correlation of optical confocal microscopy with high-resolution scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Altogether, this discovery enlivens color centers in BN materials and, because of the BN nanococoon's size, opens new and exciting opportunities in nanophotonics, quantum information, biological imaging, and nanoscale sensing.},

In this work, we study highly crystalline, single atomic layers of chemical vapour deposition (CVD)-grown hexagonal boron nitride and find predominantly one type of emissive state. Using a multidimensional super-resolution fluorescence microscopy technique we simultaneously measure spatial position, intensity and spectral properties of the emitters, as they are exposed to continuous wave illumination over minutes. As well as low emitter heterogeneity, we observe inhomogeneous broadening of emitter line-widths and power law dependency in fluorescence intermittency, this is in striking similarity to previous work on quantum dots. These results show that high control over h-BN growth and treatment can produce a narrow distribution of emitter type, and that surface interactions heavily influence the photodynamics. Furthermore, we highlight the utility of spectrally-resolved wide-field microscopy in the study of optically-active excitons in atomically thin two-dimensional materials.},

abstract = {Recently observed quantum emitters in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) membranes have a potential for achieving high accessibility and controllability thanks to the lower spatial dimension. Moreover, these objects naturally have a high sensitivity to vibrations of the hosting membrane due to its low mass density and high elasticity modulus. Here, we propose and analyze a spin-mechanical system based on color centers in a suspended hBN mechanical resonator. Through group theoretical analyses and ab-initio calculation of the electronic and spin properties of such a system, we identify a spin doublet ground state and demonstrate that a spin-motion interaction can be engineered which enables ground state cooling of the mechanical resonator. We also present a toolbox for initialization, rotation, and readout of the defect spin qubit. As a result the proposed setup presents the possibility for studying a wide range of physics. To illustrate its assets, we show that a fast and noise resilient preparation of a multicomponent cat state and a squeezed state of the mechanical resonator is possible; the latter is achieved by realizing the extremely detuned, ultrastrong coupling regime of the Rabi model, where a phonon superradiant phase transition is expected to occur.},

abstract = {Single-photon emitters play an essential role in quantum technologies, including quantum computing and quantum communications. Atomic defects in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) have recently emerged as new room-temperature single-photon emitters in solid-state systems, but the development of scalable and tunable h-BN single-photon emitters requires external methods that can control the emission energy of individual defects. Here, by fabricating van der Waals heterostructures of h-BN and graphene, we demonstrate the electrical control of single-photon emission from atomic defects in h-BN via the Stark effect. By applying an out-of-plane electric field through graphene gates, we observed Stark shifts as large as 5.4 nm per GV/ m. The Stark shift generated upon a vertical electric field suggests the existence of out-of-plane dipole moments associated with atomic defect emitters, which is supported by first-principles theoretical calculations. Furthermore, we found field-induced discrete modification and stabilization of emission intensity, which were reversibly controllable with an external electric field. KEYWORDS: Single-photon sources, hexagonal boron nitride, Stark effect, van der Waals heterostructures T wo-dimensional (2D) materials have emerged as new candidates for the building blocks of quantum devices because of their unique electronic and optical properties. 1,2 Recent reports on single-photon emitters (SPE) in transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) 3−6 and hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) 7−13 have drawn significant interest regarding 2D materials for quantum information processing. However, single photons generated from different emitters show inhomogeneous energy distribution, which would be detri-mental for potential applications in quantum communications. There has been great interest in overcoming the inhomoge-neity of SPE in these materials (for example, by optimizing the fabrication process 11,12 or by tuning the SPE's optical energy through applying strain 13 or using the Stark effect 14). In the Stark effect, the optical energy of each SPE could shift by the application of an external electric field, which is advantageous for the local control of individual emitters. The method has been demonstrated for SPE in TMDC monolayers at low temperatures. 14 For practical and more-versatile applications of 2D-based quantum photonics, however, it is necessary to integrate SPE operation at room temperature into devices with tunable electric fields. h-BN is a wide-bandgap semiconductor (E gap = 6 eV), 15 in which deep-level atomic defects produce single-photon emissions at room temperature. The structure of h-BN consists of single h-BN layers that are weakly coupled by van der Waals force in the vertical direction, appropriate for the fabrication of 2D heterostructures. 1 According to previous reports, native point defects in this system are normally expected to lie within the plane, 7 which could create an in-plane dipole that would be difficult to control with out-of-plane electric fields. However, for tunable and scalable h-BN SPE with a large density, it is highly desirable to be able to control individual atomic defects using an out-of-plane electric field. In this work, we fabricate h-BN/graphene heterostructures to apply an out-of-plane electric field to atomic defects in h-BN and observe linear Stark shifts up to 5.4 nm per GV/m. First-principles theoretical calculations provide a possible origin of the observed Stark shifts induced by out-of-plane electric fields. In addition, by applying a high gate voltage, we observe the discrete change of a defect's emitter intensity, reversibly controlled by an applied electric field. These results show the potential of h-BN/ graphene heterostructures as tunable room-temperature quantum light sources integrated in electrical circuit assemblies for scalable solid-state quantum technologies.},

Of great interest are 2D materials that host single quantum emitters. h-BN, with a band gap of 5.95 eV, has been shown to host single quantum emitters which are stable at room temperature in the UV and visible spectral range. In this paper we investigate correlations between h-BN structural features and emitter location from bulk down to the monolayer at room temperature. We demonstrate that chemical etching and ion irradiation can generate emitters in h-BN. We analyze the emitters' spectral features and show that they are dominated by the interaction of their electronic transition with a single Raman active mode of h-BN. Photodynamics analysis reveals diverse rates between the electronic states of the emitter. The emitters show excellent photo stability even under ambient conditions and in monolayers. Comparing the excitation polarization between different emitters unveils a connection between defect orientation and the h-BN hexagonal structure. The sharp spectral features, color diversity, room-temperature stability, long-lived metastable states, ease of fabrication, proximity of the emitters to the environment, outstanding chemical stability, and biocompatibility of h-BN provide a completely new class of systems that can be used for sensing and quantum photonics applications.},

We also demonstrate an all-optical gating scheme that exploits Stokes and Anti-Stokes excitation to manipulate spectral diffusion so as to switch and lock the emission energy of the photon source. In this scheme, reversible spectral jumps are deliberately enabled by pumping the emitter with high energy (Stokes) excitation; AS excitation is then used to lock the system into a fixed state characterized by a fixed emission energy.

abstract = {Combining solid state single photon emitters (SPE) with nanophotonic platforms is a key goal in integrated quantum photonics. In order to realize functionality in potentially scalable elements, suitable SPEs have to be bright, stable, and widely tunable at room temperature. In this work we show that selected SPEs embedded in a few layer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) meet these demands. In order to show the wide tunability of these SPEs we employ an AFM with a conductive tip to apply an electrostatic field to individual hBN emitters sandwiched between the tip and an indium tin oxide coated glass slide. A very large and reversible Stark shift of {\$}(5.5 \backslashpm 3)\backslash,{\$}nm at a zero field wavelength of {\$}670\backslash,{\$}nm was induced by applying just {\$}20\backslash,{\$}V, which exceeds the typical resonance linewidths of nanodielectric and even nanoplasmonic resonators. Our results are important to further understand the physical origin of SPEs in hBN as well as for practical quantum photonic applications where wide spectral tuning and on/off resonance switching are required.},
